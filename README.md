# Shulker Nesting

## Usage

This is a very simple mod for 1.16.x that allows shulker boxes to be nested inside of each other.
Warning: This can cause serious lag or crashes if abused, and as such I don't recommend installing this on servers unless you can be sure that enough RAM is allocable.

## Disclaimer

This mod does not allow shulkers to be nested on vanilla servers (this check is done server-side and the box will be rejected if you try to nest it).
Thankfully server admins need not worry :)
